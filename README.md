# responsebot


This Discord.js v13 script essentially lets a bot respond to a custom command. If you have basic knowledge of Discord.js, you can customize this script to an image, GIF, text,
etc. Have fun with this script, its simple, and for new bot developers looking to build of a basis. Keep in mind, this is v13, so you must use the shell command, 
`npm i discord.js@v13-lts` in order for it to be functionable. If you're looking for a coding program for the bot, I truly recommend Replit. I use uptimerobot to keep the bot 
runing 24/7, I prefer it over other hosting platforms, and it's free.
